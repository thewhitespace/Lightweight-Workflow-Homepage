# Lightweight Workflow Homepage
Cleanup the workflow IDE homepage to help it load faster.

This is a simple update set that removes the Youtube video and live feed from the
workflow IDE in ServiceNow.

It renames the original file in order to keep a backup and adds a new UI Page.

Should work for ServiceNow Geneva or greater.
